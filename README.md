"Accelerating trial enrolment and enhancing the diversity of clinical trial populations is imperative to advance health outcomes & patient access to novel treatments. A delay in clinical trial enrolment prohibits a robust and accurate understanding of safety and efficacy of treatments in a timely manner. Improving the enrolment of clinical trials therefore not only helps to identify targeted treatment therapies for the right patients but also reduces overall health disparities and advances health equity. 

In this project, we explore opportunities for data science to increase the understanding of quantitative socio-economic factors that impact enrolment in clinical trials as well as enhance inclusive clinical trial practices. The challenges in trial participation in diverse communities have historically only been studied qualitatively. Based on data availability, socio-economic factors impacting patient enrolment can be investigated in enrolment analyses and used to identify actionable levers (e.g. educational material, hospital transport programs, campaign) to improve patient enrolment.
